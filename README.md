# Create a Boolean Calculator

This Boolean Algebra Calculator is a Java program designed to verify the accuracy of three Boolean algebra laws: Idempotent, Associative, and Commutative Laws. The program provides users with a menu to select one of these laws and prompts them to input Boolean values for x, y, and z in various formats, including T, F, t, f, true, false, 1, 0. To ensure a smooth user experience, I implemented error handling that detects invalid inputs and prompts the user to enter correct values. Once valid inputs are received, the program evaluates both sides of the selected lawâ€™s equation using Boolean operations and displays the results, confirming whether the law holds true. This project not only reinforces fundamental Boolean algebra concepts but also incorporates key programming skills such as user input validation, logic processing, and interactive console output in Java.
